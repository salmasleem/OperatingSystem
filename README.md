# Operating system
## Project Overview
  In this project, we were asked to build a simulation of an operating system. The main focus of the project will be on building a correct architecture that simulates a real operating system
  
## System Calls
System calls are the process’s way of requesting a service from the OS. In order for a process to be able to use any of the available hardware, it makes a request, system call, to the operating system.
Types of system calls required:
1. Read the data of any file from the disk.
2. Write text output to a file in the disk.
3. Print data on the screen. 
4. Take text input from the user.
5. Reading data from memory.
6. Writing data to memory.
The memory for now refers to the variables you will initialise and assign a value to. This is achieved through the assign instruction discussed in the Program Syntax section. These variables are unique and owned by each program/process and thus are not shared. The variable names are given by the assign instruction at runtime and are not only a and b, thus your memory needs to store data with the process that owns it and the name given to it.

## Programs 
We have 3 main Programs:
Program 1: Given 2 numbers, the program prints the numbers between the 2 given numbers on the screen.
Program 2: Given a filename and data, the program writes the data to the file. Assume that the file doesn’t exist and should always be created.
Program 3: Given a filename, the program prints the contents of the file on the screen.

## Program Syntax
For the programs, the following syntax is used:
• print: to print the output on the screen. Example: print x
• assign: to initialize a new variable and assign a value to it. Example: assign x y, where x is the variable and y is the value assigned. The value could be an integer number, or a string. If y is input, it first prints to the screen "Please enter a value", then the value is taken as an input from the user.
• writeFile: to write data to a file. Example: writeFile x y, where x is the filename and y is the data.
• readFile: to read data from a file. Example: readFile x, where x is the filename
• printFromTo: to print all numbers between 2 numbers. Example: printFromTo x y, where x is the first number, and y is the second number.
• semWait: to acquire a resource. Example: semWait x, where x is the resource name. For more details refer to section Mutual Exclusion
• semSignal: to release a resource. Example: semSignal x, where x is the resource name. For more details refer to section Mutual Exclusion

## Mutual Exclusion
A mutex is a directive provided by the OS used to control access to a shared resource between processes in a concurrent system such as a multi-programming operating system by using two atomic operations, semwait and semsignal. Mutexes are used to ensure mutual exclusion over the critical section. You are required to implement 3 mutexes, one for each resource we have:
1. Accessing a file, to read or to write.
2. Taking user input
3. Outputting on the screen.
Whenever a mutex is used, either a semWait or semSignal instruction is followed by the name of the resource, userInput, userOutput or file. For an illustration, to print on the screen:-
1. semWait userOutput: any process calls it whenever it wants to print something on the screen to acquire the key of the resource.
2. semSignal userInput: any process calls it whenever it finishes printing to release the key of the resource.
Note: ONLY ONE process is allowed to use the resource at a time. If a process requests the use of a resource while it is being used by another process, it should be blocked and added to the blocked queue of this resource and the general blocked queue.

## Queues
• Ready Queue: For the processes currently waiting to be chosen to execute on the processor

• Blocked Queue: For the processes currently waiting for resources to be available

## Memory Management
The memory is of a fixed size. It is made up of 40 memory words. The memory is large enough to hold the un-parsed lines of code, variables and PCB for any of the processes. The memory is divided into memory words, each word can store 1 variable and it’s corresponding data. For simplicity, feel free to specify a naming convention for the variable names associated with the lines of code and elements of the PCB. Processes should not access any data outside their allocated memory block. A process should only be created at it’s arrival time. A process is considered created when it’s program file is read into lines and it gets assigned a part of the memory for instructions, variables and it’s PCB. Assume that each process needs enough space for 3 variables.

## Process Control Block
A process control block is a data structure used by computer operating systems to store all the information about a process.In order to schedule a processes, a PCB is kept for each process. The PCB should contain the following information:
1. Process ID (The process is given an ID when is being created)
2. Process State
3. Program Counter
4. Memory Boundaries
